      <p>ðŸŽ“ My Learning Journey
Education isn't just about textbooks â€” it's about curiosity, growth, and real-world impact.
I'm currently a Class 11 student, diving deep into the world of technology and problem-solving.
<br>
<p>From mastering C++ and Python, to exploring backend development and web technologies, I am on a mission to turn knowledge into action. Whether it's school subjects or self-taught tech skills, I believe in learning by doing.<p>
<br>
ðŸ’¡Every concept I learn brings me one step closer to building something New.                                                                                   
<br>
<p>I am studting at Oshin International School, where I am not just learning subjects, but also how to apply them in real-world scenarios. My journey is fueled by a passion for technology and a desire to make a difference.<p>                                                                
<br>
Class 11 is not just a grade; it's a stepping stone to a future where I can create, innovate, and inspire others. Join me on this exciting journey of learning and discovery!
