Hey! Iâ€™m Khushmit Bokre, a curious mind and passionate Class 11 student who's diving deep into the world of tech â€” especially backend development.

From writing my first lines of code in C++ and Python, to building web projects and exploring how the internet really works behind the scenes â€” Iâ€™m all about turning ideas into real, working solutions.

ðŸ’¡ I believe learning never stops. Whether itâ€™s debugging a tricky piece of logic, exploring new frameworks, or contributing to open-source, Iâ€™m always up for the challenge.

Outside of code, youâ€™ll find me experimenting with tech, solving problems, or learning something new every day. My goal?
To build cool stuff, grow with every project, and one day make a real impact in the world of technology.

Letâ€™s connect, collaborate, and create something awesome!</p>
